# Mexican-vs-American-minimum-wages
In this repository, I analyzed data about minimum wages over time (1994-2020) in Mexico and the United States of America. 

The data was collected from Kaggle and from macrotrends.net (https://www.macrotrends.net/2559/us-dollar-mexican-peso-exchange-rate-historical-chart).
